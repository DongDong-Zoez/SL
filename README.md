# This is a side project of the course Statistics Learning

In this project, we are generating random variable from scratch, i.e., the only distribution we can sample is Unif(0,1)

## HW4

In this work, we have implement cholesky decomposition to simulate random multivariate vectors from scratch

Furthermore, we have also implement copula to simulate exponential random vectors under specifies copula structure
